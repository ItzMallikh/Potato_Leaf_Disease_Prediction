*****POTATO PLANT LEAF DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM*****

AI-powered Potato Leaf Disease Detection System helps farmers detect diseases in potato plants using deep learning.

****Project Overview******
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify potato leaves into three categories:
1)Potato_Early_Blight 🍂

2)Potato_Late_Blight 🌧️

3)Potato_Healthy ✅

Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit, it provides an easy-to-use web interface for disease prediction.

 *****Features*****

1)Upload an image of a potato leaf or capture one with a webcam 📷

2)AI-based disease detection with high accuracy 🧠

3)Displays confidence scores 📊

4)Provides treatment recommendations 💊
